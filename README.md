# DSA-DOCUMENTATION - AJE DANIEL AYODELE
This is where I started my portfolio while taking Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub.

As part of my recent Data Analysis class, I gained hands-on experience with core tools used in data analytics, including Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Power BI. 
This course enhanced both my technical and analytical skills, equipping me to work confidently with data from raw extraction and cleaning to visualization.

## What I Learned

 Microsoft Excel
- Data Handling & Quick Analysis
- Efficient data cleaning using sorting, filtering, and removing duplicates
- Creating PivotTables to summarize large datasets and discover patterns
- Using advanced formulas: IF, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH
- Building interactive dashboards with slicers, charts, and conditional formatting
- Using Excel as a quick BI tool for reports and decision-making

 ## SQL – Data Querying and Manipulation
- Mastered SQL syntax for querying structured databases
- Performed data joins to merge tables and create unified views
- Wrote queries to perform aggregation, filtering, grouping, and sorting
- Learned to work with real-life datasets to answer business-related questions
- Developed reusable SQL scripts for data exploration and reporting

## Power BI – Data Visualization & Storytelling
- Connected and transformed data using Power Query Editor
- Built compelling and interactive dashboards to track KPIs
- Applied DAX formulas to create custom measures and calculated columns
- Created reports with drill-throughs, bookmarks, and dynamic visuals
- Published dashboards to the Power BI Service and learned basic sharing & security features


### Reflections
Learning data analysis has changed how I look at problems. I now see data not as numbers, but as stories waiting to be told. I’ve learned to ask the right questions, explore patterns, and present findings in a way that leads to smart decisions. Every dataset offers an opportunity to make an impact — and that excites me.
