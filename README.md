# DSA-DOCUMENTATION - AJE DANIEL AYODELE
This is where I started my portfolio while taking Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub.

As part of my recent Data Analysis class, I gained hands-on experience with core tools used in data analytics, including Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Power BI. 
This course enhanced both my technical and analytical skills, equipping me to work confidently with data from raw extraction and cleaning to visualization.

## What I Learned

 Microsoft Excel
- Data Handling & Quick Analysis
- Efficient data cleaning using sorting, filtering, and removing duplicates
- Creating PivotTables to summarize large datasets and discover patterns
- Using advanced formulas: IF, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH
- Building interactive dashboards with slicers, charts, and conditional formatting
- Using Excel as a quick BI tool for reports and decision-making
